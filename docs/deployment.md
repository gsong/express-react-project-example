# Deployment

This project is set up to deploy to [Heroku][], using the [Container stack][].

## Prerequisites

The [prerequisites to deploy to Heroku][prerequisites] is the same as the local
development environment.

You'll also need to [setup up the `.env` file][dotenv] in your project
directory.

## Setup

1. [Sign up for a Heroku account][sign up] if you don't already have one.
1. [Install the Heroku CLI][cli]. On macOS:

   ```sh
   brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
   ```

1. Set up an app:

   ```sh
   npm run heroku:setup
   ```

   You may be asked to login so the Heroku CLI can perform tasks in your
   account.

   At the end of the process (which will take about 5 minutes), you'll be shown
   the details of your app, including the URL of where you can access the app.

   You should see the app running in your browser. If not, just visit the URL.

## Deployment

As you make code changes to the server or the app, you can always deploy your
current working branch to see it running at Heroku:

```sh
npm run heroku:deploy
```

### Automatic Deployment

This repo also contains a [GitHub Actions][] deployment workflow. Any new
commits to the `main` branch will trigger the workflow.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You still need to run the [Heroku setup step](#setup) before
you can automatically deploy.

1. Create a Heroku API token:

   ```sh
   heroku authorizations:create -d "GitHub Actions"
   ```

   Copy the "Token" value.

1. Add the following [GitHub repository secrets][repo-secrets]:
   - `HEROKU_API_KEY`: the Heroku authorization token
   - `HEROKU_APP_NAME`: the Heroku app name (`heroku apps` if you forgot it)

From now on, whenever you push or merge into the `main` branch, GitHub will
automatically deploy the branch to Heroku! üôå

## Tips

| Task                                  | Command                          |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Access your app                       | `heroku open`                    |
| See the running app log               | `heroku logs -t`                 |
| See details about your app            | `heroku apps:info`               |
| Rename your app                       | `heroku apps:rename <NEWNAME>`   |
| Access the app dashboard              | `npm run heroku:dashboard`       |
| Access the Heroku PostgreSQL instance | `npm run heroku:psql`            |
| See the database connection string    | `heroku config:get DATABASE_URL` |
| Access the database dashboard         | `heroku addons:open DATABASE`    |

## Connecting Your Heroku App to your PG_Database

You might notice that your app on heroku still connects to the example database from this project template. This is because the Heroku configuration variable "DATABASE_URL" has not been changed yet. 

**To set this up:**

1. Check that the `seed.pgsql` file in your `/pg/` directory is correct. If it isn't, run the `pg_dump` command to create your seed file and replace the original with it. You can follow instructions for pg_dump [here](https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/postgresql/import-and-export-a-postgresql-database#Create-a-new-PostgreSQL-database-and-assign-a-user)

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure it's exported as `.pgsql` and not `.psql`. You can also simply rename the file.
  
2. From your project root directory, run:

   ```heroku pg:reset```
   
3. Next: 

   ```docker-compose run --rm -e DATABASE_URL=$(heroku config:get DATABASE_URL) db /bin/ash -c 'psql ${DATABASE_URL} < /var/tmp/pg/seed.pgsql'```

4. And you're done! Your heroku app should now be connected to the right database.
